Description: Brute force caesar cipher hack

This is a brute force algorithm to decode a text encoded with caesar cipher. It works by trying every possible key (1 to 25) and printing the possible result for each key. Than, the programa will try to indicate de most likely match by searching the words in a big wordlist that is read from a ".txt" document.

Even if the brute force don't suceed, you can look for your text by reading key per key that was printed.
